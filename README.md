Web page

I'm Miguel and I'm a fifteen year old boy that loves computers. I'm studying right now 
in the highschool, but in my free time, I also study some stuff about software development.
I really love it!

This is my first try. I'm trying to create my own web page, and post on it everything 
I try to study this years. I would love to learn everything I can, so if somebody wants 
to contact with me, I post my social media on my new page.

Let's code!
